# VBA_challenge

This repository includes the challenge for the module 2: the screenshots from the excel file with the code already run and the file with the script.

The code includes a brief description of each of the steps to develop it.

Most of the code was based in the code reviewed and used for the activities of the lessons from week 2 of the Data Analytics Bootcamp. I have also used google search and Copilot mainly for looking for codes related to formatting cells.

Although the reference picture of the challenge 2 did not include the highlight of percent change columns, I included a code to format them because the instructions requested it.
